# Collections-as-Data-Notebooks

A WORK-IN-PROGRESS curated list of awesome Jupyter notebooks for querying and analyzing library collections as data. Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 

[Collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/) is a movement to mediate library collections in computational formats. Jupyter Notebooks provide an ideal way to introduce data-based explorations of library collections.

Inspired by lists like [Awesome Jupyter: A Curated List](https://github.com/markusschanta/awesome-jupyter), this repo will pull together Collections as Data notebooks available on other Github repos, Binders, etc.

IIIF (International Image Interoerability Framework) standardizes the library curation of digital images, making scripts composed for querying IIIF data relatively easy to adapt to different digital collections

# Text

Textual data is readily available for public domain materials through various digital collections' APIS such as HathiTrust or the National Library of Scotland.
