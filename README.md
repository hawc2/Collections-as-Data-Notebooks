# Collections-as-Data Notebooks

A WORK-IN-PROGRESS curated list of awesome Jupyter notebooks for querying and analyzing library collections as data. Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 

[Collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/) is a movement to mediate library collections in computational formats. Jupyter Notebooks provide an ideal way to introduce data-based explorations of library collections.

Inspired by lists like [Awesome Jupyter: A Curated List](https://github.com/markusschanta/awesome-jupyter), this repo will pull together Collections as Data notebooks available on other Github repos, Binders, etc.

# Images

IIIF (International Image Interoerability Framework) standardizes the library curation of digital images, making scripts composed for querying IIIF data relatively easy to adapt to different digital collections

[Smithsonian IIIF Notebooks](https://github.com/hibernator11/notebook-iiif-images) - Three separate notebooks for querying IIIF manifests, downloading images, and applying rudimentary facial recognition algorithms. 

# Text

Textual data is readily available for public domain materials through various digital collections' APIS such as HathiTrust or the National Library of Scotland. 

[National Library of Scotland Text Mining Notebooks](https://data.nls.uk/tools/jupyter-notebooks/) - A half dozen notebooks for text mining corpora produced from the National Library of Scotland's collections. 

[HTRC Feature Reader](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/tree/master/examples) - The HathiTrust Research Center's Feature reader for parsing HathiTrust's collections as extracted features of page-level parts-of-speech and word frequencies across any given HathiTrust collection.

# Metadata

[British Library's Notebooks](https://github.com/BL-Labs/Jupyter-notebooks-projects-using-BL-Sources) - A wide-array of notebooks for querying British Library catalog records
